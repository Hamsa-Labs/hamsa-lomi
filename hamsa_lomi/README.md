# Hamsa Lomi
Hamsa Lomi mobile project using flutter.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

1. Install [lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook/blob/master/docs/other.md), 
which is a fast and powerful Git hooks manager for projects of any languages. After installing
run the command inside the root directory, i.e., your repository directory `lefthook install`.
This will create a `lefthook.yml` file in the root repository. This is the configuration file for
the git hook. To the **pre-commit** hook for example, you can use the `lefthook run pre-commit`
command.

2. Install the flutter SDK for your platform. Further guide can be found 
[here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

3. Navigate to the moogter_mobile directory and run the following command:
`flutter pub get` to get all packages.
