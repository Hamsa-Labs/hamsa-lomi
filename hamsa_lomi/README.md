## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nebiyuelias1/hamsa-lomi.git
   # It should clone the latest version of hamsa lomi project // Expected result
```

2.

```sh
 cd hamsa-lomi
 ls # to show how many file you have inside the project
   # You should see the following files README.md docs hamsa_lomi lefthook.yml// Expected result
```

3. Install [lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook/blob/master/docs/other.md),
   which is a fast and powerful Git hooks manager for projects of any languages. After installing
   run the command inside the root directory, i.e., your repository directory `lefthook install`.
   This will create a `lefthook.yml` file in the root repository. This is the configuration file for
   the git hook. To the **pre-commit** hook for example, you can use the `lefthook run pre-commit`
   command.

4. Install the flutter SDK for your platform. Further guide can be found
   [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

5. Navigate to the hamsa_lomi directory and run the following command:
   `flutter pub get` to get all packages.
